        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m from Miami, born and raised, but my family is from Cuba. My first language was Spanish, and my second English, but I would really love to learn Portuguese and French. I’m a Junior at the University of Miami, although technically a senior because I am graduating next semester. I’m majoring in English Literature with a minor in journalism and motion pictures. </p>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>I’m really open to working in anything! I’m not set on any specific career, but would like something relating to communications, social media, and writing. After we both graduate, my friend and I want to move to Edinburgh or London, so you’ll probably find me there. </p>

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I like to do any stereotypical grandma hobby. I love reading, writing, crocheting, puzzles, and watching tv. I also love music and am more often than not wearing my headphones.  I look forward to doing these when I actually am a grandma. </p>
